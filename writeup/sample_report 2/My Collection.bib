abstract = {As association rules widely used, it needs to study many problems, one of which is the generally larger and multi-dimensional datasets, and the rapid growth of the mount of data. Single-processor's memory and CPU resources are very limited, which makes the algorithm performance inefficient. Recently the development of network and distributed technology makes cloud computing a reality in the implementation of association rules algorithm. In this paper we describe the improved Apriori algorithm based on MapReduce mode, which can handle massive datasets with a large number of nodes on Hadoop platform.},
